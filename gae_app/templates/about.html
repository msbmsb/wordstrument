          <h2>Wordstrument takes your text and transforms it into musical notation.</h2>
          <p>The idea of this experiment is to use text - words and letters - as the driver for 
          musical output, a word instrument. Each word is assigned a note that is decided upon based on the letters in the word. The note's duration is based on the length of the word compared to the length of the average English word (about 5 characters). The goal is for the note outputs to seem reasonable and predictable, but not entirely.</p>
