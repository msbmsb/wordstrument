wordstrument
============

**Wordstrument** is a (currently experimental) webapp to use words as an instrument, as you might 
guess from the name. Words are analyzed and generate a note that is predictable in some way and not 
random. Notes are given durations, octave levels and accidentals. A scale can be selected and the 
notes sequence is put into key based on that scale. 

Output is shown using the excellent [VexFlow][] HTML5 API to display standard notation and guitar 
tablature. Future features will include audio generation.
